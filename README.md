# Python--

Hello guys... I have been working on a programming language VERY similar to python, but it has less features. I will be uploading every file into here. So it can be used... The language has the console all ready it can do math and stuff. At the point (6.1.2021) You can call the code files whatever you like, but I preferr to use (*.pmm) for python--. The language has functions and they can be run in the console with the command 'RUN()'. Every main command like RUN, OR, IF, ELIF, ELSE will be with higher case letters.. If you want to use the language with a file, then create a file with the ending .pmm and you can code in it... When you want to run it go to command prompt or (linux/macOs) terminal. You need to be on the directory where you have saved the files and then run 'python3 shell.py' in the cmd...
